## How to make anaglyph 3d images from photos

### What are the 3d images we are talk about ?
3d images are nothing but 2 overlapping images on the screen, but one of our eyes will see only one out of these two images at a time
This is achieved using mulitple ways. One cheap and common option is to use a red and cyan glass. The left eye is covered with a red glass and the right eye with a cyan (blue + green) glass, such that each eye will perceive respective images from the red-cyan mixed 3d image.


### How to make a 3d anaglyph photo of yours
Click two photos using your smartphone or any camera device. One photo is for the left eye and the other for the right eye.
So, we have to maintain the same orientation while taking these pictures. The left and right images are clicked from 2 points horizontally ~ 5cm apart.
Also make sure that there is no moving objects in the photo. Say "statue" before clicking the two photos.

### Upload and adjust the alignments on Aynan web app
- Upload the photos
- Select "Anaglyph" from the options (bottom)
- Choose Left and Right photos from the dropdown menu
- Use sliders to adjust the alignment, 
- Make red and cyan separation smaller as much as possible, for the objects in focus,
